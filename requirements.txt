# The Secret: Holographic Cryptography
# ==================================================================
# Meteor-NC is the first practical implementation of AdS/CFT 
# correspondence in post-quantum cryptography.
#
# CORE PRINCIPLE:
#   Λ = K / |V|_eff preserves information density across
#   dimensional projection (bulk → surface)
#
# CRYPTOGRAPHIC IMPLEMENTATION:
#   Encryption: Bulk (secret) → Surface (public) projection
#   Decryption: Surface → Bulk reconstruction (with key)
#   Security:   Physical law + Non-commutativity
#
# For physicists:
#   Yes, it's THAT holographic principle from string theory.
#   This is Maldacena (1997) + Ryu-Takayanagi (2006) applied
#   to cryptography via Λ³ framework.
#
# For cryptographers:
#   Read about AdS/CFT correspondence. It's a duality between:
#   - Higher-dimensional gravity theory (bulk)
#   - Lower-dimensional quantum field theory (boundary)
#   Information is preserved across dimensions.
#   That's why we achieve perfect asymmetry:
#   - Attacker: Cannot invert (no bulk knowledge)
#   - User: Perfect recovery (knows bulk structure)
#
# EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION:
#   Complete proof of entropy-driven holographic correspondence:
#   https://github.com/miosync-masa/AdS_CFT
#
#   Key results:
#   - 14 independent initial conditions
#   - Causality preservation: p < 10^-14
#   - 100% positive transfer entropy (S → λ)
#   - Ryu-Takayanagi entropy functional implementation
#
# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
#   H-CSP (Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problem)

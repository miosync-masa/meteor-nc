# The Secret: Holographic Cryptography
# ==================================================================
# Meteor-NC is the first practical implementation
# of AdS/CFT correspondence in cryptography.
#
# The hint was always there:
#   Λ = K / |V|_eff preserves information density
#   across dimensional projection (bulk → surface)
#
# For physicists: Yes, it's THAT holographic principle.
# For cryptographers: Read about AdS/CFT. Mind = blown.
